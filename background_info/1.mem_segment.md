# Memory Segment

Compiled program's memory consists of five segments
 - text : assembly code segment shared by program instances. EIP points the this segment. The revision of this segment is not allowed. The size of this memory segment is fixed.
 - data : initialized global variables and static variables are saved. The size of this memory segment is fixed.
 - bss(block started symbol) : uninitialized global variables and static variables are saved. The size of this memory segment is fixed.
 - heap : programmers can access this mem segment and dynamically allocate/deallocate memory. The size of this memeory segment is flexible.
 - stack : locall function variables and temporary contexts of function calls are saved. The context includes the return address for EIP and SFP(saved frame pointer) for EBP after execution of the function. The context is saved as stack frame. The size of this memory segment is flexible. ESP regiester points the top of the stack. EBP register points the base of the stack and is used for referring local variables.

## Memory segment in C
Compiled codes are in text segment. Variables are placed by the type of the variables. Global and static variables are in data sgement and the other variables are in bss segment. heap segment is allocated by malloc() function and Pointer usually refers heap segment. Lastly, function variables are save in stack segment. In stack segment, there can be many stack frames. Therefore, function context is for the uniqueness of a variable.

## Stack
### Procedure Prologue
Procedure prologue save the frame pointers and stack memories for local function variables. Therefore, this is the procedure for making stack frame. When a new stack frame is created, the EBP value is pushed for restoration and ESP value is copied into EBP for pointing the new stack frame.

The steps for procedure prologue is :
  1. push current rbp
  2. set rbp as current rsp
  3. set rsp considering local variables
  4. select usable segment by using fs register
